  "My dearest Janvi, every star in this constellation whispers about how lucky am I to find you as my friend. There are times I feel lost & lonely without your smile, subtle taunts and practical advice. Distance is just a number when we mean everything to each other. You are my sunshine in the darkest nights, I always think about you when I see the moon. I really owe you more than all the stars combined. I know you janvi inside out you are great with some flaws, imperfect with some decisions and stubborn with mindset which inversely are great, But atlast, I wish you all the best for everything you want to achieve in life, Ain't nobody gonna love you like I love you, Ain't nobody gonna want you like I want you, Ain't nobody gonna trust you like I trust you |💕✨";

export const finalMessage = `Some days I feel a bit empty when I don't hear your voice or your laugh. I really miss your smile, your talks, your anger and all our stupid jokes. I miss our random food plans, scooty-rides in streets of matunga, bandra are the worst of all cravings, eating dessert at night while walking in matunga, sneaky moves while your mom is going for a walk, all those terrace nights. And of course, our special talent of bitching about people from our own circle 😅.

Life feels a bit boring without all this madness with you. This world gets too noisy sometimes, but talking to you always makes things feel better. Distance doesn't matter much because you're already in my heart. I'm waiting for the day we meet again and restart the life we always dream about. Till then, just know I really miss you and sorry for the past mistakes I mean it a lot and feel guilty about it more than you know 🌙💕🤍`;
