There are times I feel lost & lonely without your radiant smile, subtle taunts and practical advice. Distance is just a number when you mean everything to me after my family. You are my sunshine in the darkest nights, my anchor in the stormiest seas. I really owe you more than all the stars combined (sorry I still owe you the money). I know you khush inside out you are great with some flaws, imperfect with some decisions and stubborn with mindset which inversely are great, But atlast, I wish you all the best for everything you want to achieve in this life, and yes be on the life motto | I didn't sign up for this shit |💕✨";

export const finalMessage = `Some days I feel a bit empty when I don't hear your voice or your laugh. I really miss your smile, your talks, your bakbak and all our stupid jokes. I miss our random food plans, idli wada at Charni Road are the worst of all cravings, eating mango ice cream or any icecream at night while walking on those silent roads. And of course, our special talent of bitching about people from our own neighbourhood 😅.

Life feels a bit boring without all this madness with you. This world gets too noisy sometimes, but talking to you always makes things feel better. Distance doesn't matter much because you're already in my heart. I'm waiting for the day we meet again and restart our food walks and nonsense. Till then, just know I really miss you and sorry for the past mistakes I mean it a lot and feel guilty about it more than you know 🌙💕🤍`;
